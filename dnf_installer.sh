### I use this script to automate the installation of a bunch of basic useful applications via dnf package manager on a fresh local Fedora install. 
### Some of these applications are already pre-installed on desktop environments but I've added them anyways for those running from a minimal environment.

# Initial check to ensure run as root
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
	echo "~ This script must be run as root. Please restart with 'sudo'. ~" 1>&2
	exit 1
